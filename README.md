# Analysis of the _Zizania palustris_ genome
Annotation of the Zizania palustris genome

9 July 2019: We don't yet have RNA-seq data to do annotation, so the first thing I am trying is using the Oryza sativa genome to find similar genes in the Zizania palustris genome.

30 July 2019: Added starter code for making a dot plot to compare the genomes of _Oryza sativa_ and _Zizania palustris_.

14 January 2020: This past fall, we decided to seek help from the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute Research Informatics Support Specialists (MSI RISS) for the genome annotation since it somewhat beyond my expertise. Today, they gave us an update via a Powerpoint file with some explanations via email.

## snp_density_on_linkage_group.R
This file contains code to create a visual representation of each chromosome/linkage group/scaffold.
At present, it only does this for Scaffold 1. I didn't want to spend time on the other scaffolds unless I thought it would be worth while spending the time to do each scaffold (whether for a presentation or for a paper).
