# Analysis of the _Zizania palustris_ genome
Annotation of the Zizania palustris genome

9 July 2019: We don't yet have RNA-seq data to do annotation, so the first thing I am trying is using the Oryza sativa genome to find similar genes in the Zizania palustris genome.

30 July 2019: Added starter code for making a dot plot to compare the genomes of _Oryza sativa_ and _Zizania palustris_.
